## The Story

_In the misty forests of the Great Northwest, a young man named Owen leads an unremarkable existence until his sister Lily introduces him to an ancient cult that reveres the myths of old. Desperate for purpose, Owen is swiftly initiated through mysterious rituals and archaic chants promising enlightenment. As part of his indoctrination, he is tasked with becoming a Bigfoot hunter, venturing deep into the wilderness to seek out these fabled creatures._ 

_One fateful night, Owen's life is forever altered when he comes face-to-face with a towering family of Bigfoot. Though initially awestruck by their majestic presence, a creeping sense of dread begins to take hold as he realizes these are no mere myths, but living, breathing entities that seem to exude an otherworldly malevolence. This encounter marks the start of a series of bizarre and terrifying experiences._

_In the ensuing weeks, Owen's life devolves into a waking nightmare of alien abductions, malicious Skinwalker sightings, and unsettling encounters with sinister fairies. Each occurrence leaves him more unnerved than the last, yet the cult celebrates them as signs of divine favor. What once inspired fascination now breeds overwhelming fear, as the eyes that first shone with ancient wisdom now blaze with palpable evil intent._

_The turning point comes during an excruciating alien abduction when Owen confronts the horrifying truth - he has become an unwitting vessel, his soul slowly being consumed by these ancient demonic entities through the cult's very rituals. Realizing he has been tricked into partaking in his own possession, Owen embarks on a harrowing quest to sever the unholy bond and regain his freedom._
